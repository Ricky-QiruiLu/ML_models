# Merchant classification and churn prediction

Given the transaction data for our merchant, there are 2 question:

1. We have limited data on these merchants and their transactions, but we are still interested in understanding their payments activity to try to infer the types of merchants using our platform. Using only the given data, how would you identify different kinds of businesses in the sample? Please generate assignments for each merchant.

2. Sometimes a merchant may stop processing with our platform, which we call churn. We are interested in identifying and predicting churn. Please a) come up with a concrete definition for churn b) identify merchants that have already churned in the dataset, and c) build a model to predict which active merchants are most likely to churn in the near future.
